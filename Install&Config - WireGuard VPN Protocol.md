#### A VPN is a secure/encrypt tunnel between your device and a secure Server, then sending your traffic through it. 

### A Tunnel is a medium created between two devices/nodes through which traffic flow to and from. A Secure Tunnel is a Tunnel with only a secure data/traffic exchange between the nodes.

### The driving force (ie Protocol) creating each encrypted tunnel, which determines that tunnelâ€™s shape and sizes. WireGuard is just one of the several different types of protocols used to create these tunnels.

### WireGuard is a communication protocol and free and open-source software that implements encrypted virtual private network (VPN), and was designed with the goal of easy use, high speed performance, and low attack surface. WireGuard cryptographic primitives may be faster and it is built into the Linux Kernel.
